// Preview audio is media playback like any other app's, and Android arbitrates that with audio
// focus. Without a request the preview mixes on top of whatever the user is already listening to
// and nothing ever tells it to stop; without the becoming-noisy broadcast it keeps playing out of
// the loudspeaker the instant a headphone is unplugged, which is the failure that happens in
// public. Both land in the same place: pause the engine, which is all the native callback does.
//
// Every method here runs on the Android UI thread — the C++ side hops there before calling — and
// that is the thread the focus listener and the receiver are dispatched on too, so the static
// state below needs no locking.
