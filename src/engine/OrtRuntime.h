// Loading ONNX Runtime, which BASE does not link.
//
// The runtime is an addon like any other bulky optional thing: the app ships headers only and
// dlopens whichever build the user installed, so the CPU / CUDA / WebGPU decision is theirs and
// costs nobody who does not want it 267 MB. That is only possible because the C++ API is a header
// wrapper over one function table — with ORT_API_MANUAL_INIT defined, `OrtGetApiBase` is the sole
// symbol that has to come from the library, and everything else follows from the table it returns.
//
// The consequence for every caller: nothing in Ort:: may be touched before ensureLoaded() has
// returned true, including construction of an Ort::Env or Ort::MemoryInfo, because until then the
// table pointer is null. That is why env() and cpuMemory() live here instead of being members of
// the four model classes.
