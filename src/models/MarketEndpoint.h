// Where the marketplace client fetches from. Both values are configured in CMakeLists.txt
// (BASE_MARKET_API_URL / BASE_MARKET_CLIENT_KEY) and injected as compile definitions — this
// header only reads them, so there is one place to change the service.
//
// The key is NOT a user secret and is not treated as one: it ships inside every copy of BASE
// and anyone who rebuilds from source can pull it out of the binary. Its job is to HMAC-sign
// requests and derive a stable client id so casual users cannot mint a new quota by deleting
// app data. Rotate it by deploying a new API secret and shipping a new build; old builds then
// lose marketplace access.
//
// A translation unit built outside the `drift` target gets no service rather than a stale
// hardcoded one.
