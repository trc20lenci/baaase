// Touch feedback, in the vocabulary of the interaction rather than of the actuator: call sites say
// what just happened and this decides what it feels like. The mapping onto platform constants lives
// in android/src/app/base/editor/Haptics.java.
//
// Two things every call site gets for free, and which are the difference between this feeling
// deliberate and feeling broken:
//
//   * A rate limit. A drag across a dense timeline crosses snap targets faster than a motor can
//     resolve them, and one tick per move event is a continuous rumble, not feedback.
//   * Edge triggering, for the two states that persist across many move events — the snap a clip is
//     currently held by, and the track it is currently over. Those report their *identity* on every
//     update and only fire when it changes, so parking on a snap stays silent and moving between
//     two snaps a frame apart still ticks twice.
//
// Every entry point is a no-op off Android, so QML calls into it unconditionally; the desktop
// timeline shares these components.
