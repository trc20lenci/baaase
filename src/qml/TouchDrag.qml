// one on Android, and it cannot cross a modal Popup — which is exactly what the
// asset sheet is. So the browsers lift their cards into this instead. The item
// that started the gesture keeps the touch grab and feeds coordinates in here,
// the sheet steps aside rather than closing (closing would destroy the grab
// mid-flight), and the timeline registers itself as the drop target and does its
// own hit-testing on release.
